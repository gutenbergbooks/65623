<p class="drop-cap">A<span class="smcap">s</span> far back as we can trace the early history of man,
under civilized conditions of life, we find that shoes
of some kind have been worn.</p>

<p>At first they were very crude and simple, being nothing
more than soles fastened to the foot by means of
thongs or straps, which passed between the toes and
around the ankle, like Figs. <a href="#Page_3">1, 2, 3</a>. Shoes of this description
were called sandals, and were worn by the ancient
Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans.</p>

<p>It has been discovered, by means of paintings on the
walls of Thebes, that shoemaking formed a distinct and
quite lucrative trade away back in the reign of Thothmes
<abbr title="the third">III</abbr>., some fifteen hundred years before Christ, so
that followers of the awl and last can truthfully boast of
the great antiquity of their profession.</p>

<p>The material chiefly employed in the manufacture of
shoes, from the earliest times to the present, has been
leather, though stuffs of various kinds and colors have
entered into their composition at different periods.</p>

<p>The sandals worn by the priests of ancient Egypt
were generally made of palm and papyrus leaves fastened
together. Some well-preserved specimens of these
sandals, obtained from tombs, can now be seen at the
British Museum, in London.</p>

<p>Such were the shoes probably worn by Rhodope, the
Cinderella of the Nile. Rhodope was said to have the
loveliest foot in all Egypt. One day, as she was taking
her bath, an eagle stooped from Heaven and carried off
her sandal. She watched him as he soared on high,
until he finally disappeared in the distance.</p>

<p>When, after a time, he let the sandal drop, it fell at the
feet of the King, who was so charmed with its beauty
that he commanded that a search be made immediately
for its owner. Rhodope was soon discovered, and
shortly afterwards became the Queen of Egypt.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In both ancient Greece and Rome we find that, while
it was common for the women to wear some kind of a foot
covering, shoes were not generally worn by the men or
youth, the latter always being taught to go barefooted.
But later on, on ceremonial occasions, the magistrates
began to wear a red shoe, while the soldiers took to a
boot reaching almost to the knee, very elaborate in design,
and in a short time the custom of wearing a covering
for the feet was adopted by all classes. The shoes
of the women were always white in color, the senators
black, while the magistrates kept to themselves red.</p>

<p>In eastern countries we find the Japanese wearing a
shoe of rice and straw woven together (Fig. <a href="#Page_5">5</a>). This
material is very light and soon wears out; so, when
starting on a journey of any length, it is customary to
take a number of pairs of shoes with one, leaving the old
ones along the roadside as they become unfit for use.</p>

<p>The Japanese, on entering a house, observe the same
rule as the Turk on going into his mosque, always taking
off their shoes and leaving them at the threshold,
lest they might soil the door-mats, for which they have
a peculiar and marked respect. The military in Japan
wear a kind of clog, covered with movable metallic
plaques (Fig. <a href="#Page_5">4</a>). To this is attached a sole of wood or
plaited straw, which is held on the foot by means of a
roll passing between the toes.</p>

<p>The Chinese, we all know, have, for ages past, religiously
devoted themselves to dwarfing the feet of their
women of the higher classes, so that it is not at all uncommon
to find a full-grown woman with a foot as small
as a child’s of four or five with us.</p>

<p>Of late years this barbarous custom has been gradually
dying out, and now one can occasionally come
across a woman whose feet have not been distorted;
still, when they are allowed to wear shoes of natural size
and form, they are usually fixed on high, conical soles,
like Figure <a href="#Page_5">8</a>, which renders walking very difficult.
But the Chinese women are not expected to walk much,
as their lives are passed in seclusion and retirement.</p>

<p>Some of the shoes worn by the ladies are very beautiful,
indeed (Figs. <a href="#Page_5">6 &amp; 7)</a>, being made of delicate pink and
blue satin embroidered with birds and flowers.</p>

<p>The men generally wear black satin boots with white
soles, which they lay off in summer for shoes made of
plaited bamboo, with cork soles.</p>

<p>In India, shoes are worn only by the higher classes,
and a few of the lower castes. This habit of going
shoeless seems to render the toes of the Hindoo almost
as lissom as fingers. Sitting at his work, if his hands
are employed he can use his feet to pick up any article
he may require, as the big toe becomes quite prehensile.</p>

<p>Among the Persians we find that in ancient times
one of low stature was generally looked upon with dishonor;
hence arose high heels to repair the deficiency of
nature. At first they were worn only by actors and
actresses on the stage, but were afterwards adopted by
all classes, even those whose stature required no additional
height blindly conforming to the prevailing fashion,
as many people do at the present day.</p>

<p>Some of the shoes worn in Eastern countries, at different
times, have been very interesting (Figs. <a href="#Page_7">9, 10,
11,</a> <a href="#Page_9">12, 13, 14).</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span></p>
<div class="chapter">

<p>Figure <a href="#Page_7">11</a> shows a lady’s shoe richly painted with
small flowers. In front is a knob of brilliant color, divided
into segments to imitate the petals of a flower,
and at every step the wearer takes she presses a spring
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>concealed under the sole, which causes the petals to
alternately open and close. One can easily imagine
the sensation such a shoe would cause, seen promenading
along any of our prominent thoroughfares for the
first time.</p>

<p>The shoes worn by the wealthy are of the richest description,
being overlaid with gold and silver, and embroidered
with precious stones. Others, like Figure <a href="#Page_9">14</a>,
are adorned with inlaid work of pearls or delicate shells
set in gold, closely resembling <i>cloissonne</i> enamel, while
many employ the wings of gorgeous insects in their
decoration.</p>

<p>The color of shoes in the East seems to be a matter
of importance, indicating the rank or caste of the wearer,
red and yellow being the favorite shades.</p>

<p>In olden times the Mohammedans were very jealous
that none should wear yellow but themselves, wishing
it to be preserved as their distinctive mark; and there
is an old story which tells how some charitable person
gave a Christian beggar an old pair of yellow slippers,
and the Sultan happening to see them had the old man
thrown into prison, and despite his explanations and
protestations of innocence would not spare his life.</p>

<p>Leaving the East, and coming back to Europe, we
find that in the early days of the Church at Rome there
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>lived a pious man named Crispin, and his brother, who
became converted to Christianity, and leaving their native
village traveled into France and Britain.</p>

<p>While on their travels they supported themselves by
making shoes, which they sold to the poor at very low
prices.</p>

<p>(There is a legend which says that an angel supplied
them with all the leather, which probably accounts for
their moderate charges.) At any rate, they are said to
have done a great deal of good among the poor, but
were finally martyred for their faith, in the third century.
Ever since their memory has been celebrated by the
faithful of their craft with great rejoicing and merriment
on the 25th of October, which is known as St. Crispin’s
Day, while he is considered the patron saint of all shoemakers.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the ninth and tenth centuries, we find the use of
wooden shoes, or <i>sabots</i>, very general throughout Europe,
princes of all degrees wearing them. Their reign
was of short duration, however, as they were soon relegated
to the poorer classes, by whom they have been
worn ever since.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="figcenter">
<a id="i_13" name="i_13"><img src="images/i_13.jpg" alt="" width="380" height="550" /></a>

<p>One would think, from their clumsy appearance (Fig.
<a href="#Page_11">16</a>), that it must be rather awkward work to walk in
them, but the peasants do not seem to find it so, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>even indulge in the “light fantastic” with considerable
grace and freedom of motion.</p>

<p>Their chief objection, however, is the noise they
make. Having lived for some time in the close
vicinity of a public school in Brittany, where some
one or two hundred children were in daily attendance,
wearing these wooden sabots, I have a very distinct
recollection of the din and clatter these little ones
would make, as they raced each other down the hill on
their release from school. Not many years ago an attempt
was made to introduce wooden shoes into the
United States, but it met with so little success that its
projectors were forced to abandon the scheme.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In Venice we find that the custom in olden times was
to have the shoes of the women mounted very high,
so as to make walking as difficult as possible. By this
means jealous husbands thought they would be able to
keep their wives at home; but the plan did not succeed
very well, I believe.</p>

<p>Figs. <a href="#Page_11">17 and 18</a> show the Venetian shoes of this period,
the sixteenth century. The first one, of white
leather, is cut out in a delicate lace-work pattern, furnished
with a broad sole, and would have been comfortable
enough, were it not for its high support.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span></p>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="figcenter">
<a id="i_15" name="i_15"><img src="images/i_15.jpg" alt="" width="376" height="550" /></a>

<p class="caption center p90"><em>Fig. 27.</em></p>
</div></div>
<p class="space-above2"></p>

<p>These supports, or <i>chapineys</i>, as they were called by
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>the Venetians, were made of wood and covered with
leather of different colors. Many were curiously
painted, while the richest were of gilt. The height of
these <i>chapineys</i> was determined by the rank of the
wearer, the noblest ladies often having them one-half
yard or more high. Of course no woman could walk
easily, hampered with such appendages, so all that could
at all afford it would have one or two attendants to
support them on either side when they walked abroad;
and even thus supported, walking was extremely difficult.</p>

<p>Finally, the daughters of one of the Doges came to
the conclusion that the fashion was abominable, and
they would stand it no longer. It was not long before
their suffering sisters became of the same mind, and the
fashion gradually died out.</p>

<p>When Charles <abbr title="the first">I</abbr>. first met his future wife at Dover,
he seemed surprised to find her so tall, and, having
made some remark to that effect, she answered him as
follows: “Sire, I stand upon my own feet. I have no
help of art. Thus high I am; I am neither higher or
lower,” wishing him to understand, it seems, that her
fine stature was not due to artificial means.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#Page_11">15</a> represents a highly ornamented clog of this
period, while Figure <a href="#Page_11">19</a> shows another style of Venetian
pattern.</p>

<p>On page 13 we have two shoes from Africa, Figs. <a href="#Page_13">21
and 22.</a> The first, of yellow leather, is quite simple in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>design, but the latter is more elaborate in decoration.
Fig. <a href="#Page_13">24</a> shows an Indian shoe, while Fig. <a href="#Page_13">23</a> is a Persian
boot, whose pointed front is supposed to have been designed
for the purpose of preventing the wearer from
kicking up the dust, so unpleasant in hot countries.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In France the clothing of the foot has always been a
subject of special consideration, and many have been
the styles that have emanated from there. Among the
first was the long pointed shoe, called the <i>poulaine</i> (Fig.
<a href="#Page_15">25</a>), in England named <i>crakowes</i>. (This name, <i>poulaine</i>,
seems to indicate that the fashion came from
Poland, though the pointed shoe is supposed to be of
Eastern origin.) These shoes grew both in favor and
length, for a number of years, until the <i>poulaine</i> had
reached such proportions that it was necessary to fasten
it to the knee by means of a chain of gold or silver,
while in order to keep it in shape it had to be stuffed
with hay, straw, or fine moss. The length of the <i>poulaine</i>
was determined in the same manner as the height
of the <i>chapineys</i>, by the rank of the wearer, and it was
no uncommon sight to find a nobleman with his <i>poulaine</i>
some twelve inches or more in extent, while the
upper part of his shoes would be cut out to imitate the
windows of a church.</p>

<p>When the crusading army was before Nicopolis, these
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span><i>poulaines</i> astonished the Turks very much, who probably
wondered how fighting was to be done in them. When
it came to decisive action, however, it was found that the
<i>poulaines</i> impeded the movements of the knights so
much that an order was given to cut them off.</p>

<p>There was also made, at this time, in order to avoid
trailing the <i>poulaines</i> in the mud of the narrow streets,
a kind of wooden clog (Fig. <a href="#Page_15">27</a>), with cross-bars edged
with iron; this was fastened to the foot by an embroidered
leather strap. By means of this contrivance the
<i>poulaines</i> were kept from contact with the ground.</p>

<p>This fashion flourished for a long time despite the
anathemas of the bishops, who stigmatized them as immoral,
and the denunciations of officials.</p>

<p>By an act of Parliament, in 1463 shoemakers were
prohibited from making, for the lower classes, shoes with
points more than two inches long; and afterwards excommunication
was pronounced on any person found
wearing them; so they were forced to retire, after a vigorous
reign of almost three centuries.</p>

<p>From the <i>poulaine</i>, fashion ran into the opposite extreme,
and in the sixteenth century people wore shoes
with square toes as broad, and sometimes broader, than
they were long (Fig. <a href="#Page_15">26</a>). They had no straps, and were
only held on the foot by the narrow piece rising above
the heel. It was shoes of this kind that were worn by
Francis <abbr title="the first">I</abbr>. of France, and Henry <abbr title="the eighth">VIII</abbr>. of England.</p>

<p>In the latter country they were abolished during the
reign of Mary Tudor. The examples given are believed
to be German, and must have belonged to a person of
high rank, from their decoration.</p>

<p>Another early example of a French shoe is Fig. <a href="#Page_17">29</a>.
It is of white stuff ornamented on the instep with a large
rosette of silver lace and a long metal point. The heel
is so high that the wearer must have literally walked on
her toes. Another female shoe of interest is from the
wardrobe of Catherine de Medicis, Fig. <a href="#Page_17">28</a>. The shoe,
of white leather, no longer has the toe pointed but is
square in shape, covered to the instep with silk, on
which are worked figures in silver lace, giving to it the
appearance of a metal surface. This shoe is peculiar,
in having a sole which connects the toe and heel
together in the form of a pattern.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#Page_17">30</a> shows a shoe of this period, of delicate workmanship.
The toe has now become quite round, while
the leather is slashed to show the stocking underneath.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#Page_19">31</a> represents an Italian shoe of the seventeenth
century; Fig. <a href="#Page_19">33</a> is another style of the peaked shoe, of
the same date. Fig. <a href="#Page_19">32</a> is thought to be Flemish in origin,
and of the eighteenth century. The heel and back
are not unlike in shape the shoe worn during the Regency
in France, but the peculiar front-piece makes us
think that this shoe could never have been very popular
for every-day wear.</p>

<p>During the Revolution in France, there was quite a
mania for classic styles in shoes, and many ladies in high
society adopted the Greek and Roman sandals, which
were fastened on the foot by gay-colored ribbons.
Mme. Tallien once appeared at a ball in such sandals,
with her toes decorated with diamond rings.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#Page_21">34</a> shows the shoe of the unfortunate Duke de
Montmorency, a victim of the relentless animosity of Richelieu.
It is of black leather, with a large red heel, and
entirely covered with ornaments; tradition says it was
gathered on the scaffold. Fig. <a href="#Page_21">35</a> represents a highly
ornamented lady’s shoe of this period, while Fig. <a href="#Page_21">36</a> is a
shoe worn during the Regency. The heel is very high
and not unlike a barber’s wig-stand; the front, however,
is rather graceful in shape.</p>

<p>Figs. <a href="#Page_23">37</a> and <a href="#Page_23">38</a> are samples of the curiously carved
wooden shoes which were worn by ladies at the end of
the sixteenth century. Fig. <a href="#Page_23">39</a> represents a black leather
shoe of Louis <abbr title="the fourteenth">XIV</abbr>., with red heel; these were in high
favor at court at this time.</p>

<p>The use of boots marks a conquering race. In Germany,
during the Middle Ages, serfs were forbidden to
wear them; and this probably explains why, when they
rose for justice, after ages of oppression, they chose for
their standard a great peasant’s shoe. The samples of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>boots given are from the time of Louis <abbr title="the fourteenth">XIV</abbr>. and <abbr title="fifteenth">XV</abbr>.
Fig. <a href="#Page_25">40</a> was called the cauldron boot; this had a peculiar
appendage around the ankle. Fig. <a href="#Page_25">41</a>, the bellows
boot, has an enormous top, so that a man could hardly
wear a pair without straddling. Fig. <a href="#Page_25">42</a>, the postillion’s
boot; these were generally made of very heavy material,
so if the postillion, by chance, should fall from his horse,
the wheels of the carriage might pass over his legs without
doing him any injury.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We have now followed the various changes that shoes
have undergone from the earliest times to the present,
and would bring our remarks to a close with a notice of
some of the shoes of to-day furnished by J. &amp; J. Slater,
which, if not as fantastic in shape as some that we have
treated, cannot be excelled for grace or durability.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#Page_27">43</a> is a Ladies’ Riding Boot, made of morocco and
patent-leather. This style is the only correct one at
present, and no riding costume is complete without
them.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#Page_27">44</a> represents Ladies’ Button Boot. The material
employed is kid top, with patent-leather foxing.
This makes not only a very stylish but comfortable
walking boot.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#Page_29">45</a> shows Ladies’ Toilet Slipper. It is made of
Suéde kid lined with silk. This material is now the
latest style for dress or toilet slippers.</p>

with patent-leather tips. This is a delightful summer
walking shoe, either for city or country wear.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#Page_31">47</a> is a Gentleman’s Riding Boot, the only proper
boot for park riding.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#Page_31">49</a>, Gentleman’s Oxfords, or summer walking

<p>The above are but a few of the various styles introduced
by them, and a visit to their establishment will
convince all of the high reputation their goods have
achieved in the last twenty-five years.</p>

<p>Shoes have not only been used for their natural purpose
of covering the feet, but from remote time have
played a part in many of the important actions of life.
Years ago it was the custom in Ireland to elect a person
to a certain office by throwing an old shoe over his
head. But on one occasion an excited elector, whose
place it was to throw the shoe, aimed too low, so that
the shoe hit the candidate on the head, instantly killing
him. After this occurrence the practice fell into disrepute.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span></p>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="figcenter">
<a id="i_29" name="i_29"><img src="images/i_29.jpg" alt="" width="385" height="550" /></a>
<p class="caption center p90"><em>Fig. 45.</em></p>
<p class="caption center p90"><em>Fig. 46.</em></p>
</div></div>
<p class="space-above2"></p>

<p>In England it was once customary to bind contracts
by the exchange of old shoes, while we are all familiar
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>with the practice of throwing an old shoe after a bride
for good luck; but I wonder how many know what it
originally signified. It is a custom that has come to us
from the Saxons, and with them denoted that the authority
under which the bride lived while in her father’s
home was now delivered over to the husband, who was
privileged to exact implicit obedience from his wife.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Shoes have also had their share of superstition attached
to them, it being considered to portend great evil, if by
chance one should put the right shoe on the left foot,
or <i>vice versa</i>. Even one of the Roman Emperors is
said to have run the greatest risk from just this cause
alone.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">“Augustus having by o’ersight,</div>
    <div class="verse">Put on his left shoe for his right,</div>
    <div class="verse">Had like to have been slain that day,</div>
    <div class="verse">By soldiers mutinying for their pay.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But in this day of button shoes the dangers to be incurred
from this cause are very slight.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
